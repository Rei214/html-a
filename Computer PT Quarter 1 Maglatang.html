 <h3> Why do I exactly like my interests? </h3>
 
<p>I love my interests becuase they keep me entertained and they also make me feel happy </p>
<p> I love to play <strong>chess</strong> because it not only serves as entertainment but also helps me learn how to <em>strategize</em>. </p>
<p> I used to dislike <strong>math</strong> because it felt difficult. But over time I decided to focus on the subject and it turns out I really <em>enjoy</em> it</p>
<p> <strong>Video games</strong> have always been my go to whenever I feel sad. When Im playing I feel like Im away from the world and it helps me <em>relax</em>. </p>
<p> Recently I tried <strong>coding</strong> for the first time in my Computer 10 class. I was instantly fascinated. I dug deeper into the topic and now Im <em>addicted to coding</em>. </p>

<p> That is all to know about me! Thank you very much </p>
